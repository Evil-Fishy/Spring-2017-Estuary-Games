Branch for Team 7 Estuary Game
==============================

All of our files are in the 'src' folder and our images are in the 'resources' folder. Within 'src', our games can easily be distinguished by their respective folders along with the MVC division of each game in the subfolders.

When grading, some parts of the controller were untestable, especially in the master.
